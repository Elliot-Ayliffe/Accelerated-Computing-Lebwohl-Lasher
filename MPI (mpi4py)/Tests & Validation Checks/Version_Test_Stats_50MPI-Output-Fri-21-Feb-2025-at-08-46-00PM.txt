# NEW VERSION PERFORMANCE VALIDATION RESULTS
This is a test to check that a new modified version of the Lebwohl-Lasher code still
 works correctly and produces comparable outputs to the original program
#=======================================================================================
# REDUCED ENERGY:
Original Code: Mean = -7225.22, SD = 1156.889, Range = (-8043.229, -2476.6035)
New Version: Mean = -6624.91, SD = 1251.220, Range = (-7704.1067, -2499.3209)

# ORDER PARAMETER:
Original Code: Mean = 0.34, SD = 0.033, Range = (0.2523, 0.3928)
New Version: Mean = 0.33, SD = 0.025, Range = (0.2675, 0.3559)
