# NEW VERSION PERFORMANCE VALIDATION RESULTS
This is a test to check that a new modified version of the Lebwohl-Lasher code still
 works correctly and produces comparable outputs to the original program
#=======================================================================================
# REDUCED ENERGY:
Original Code: Mean = -7225.22, SD = 1156.889, Range = (-8043.229, -2476.6035)
New Version: Mean = -7246.60, SD = 1180.407, Range = (-8056.032, -2436.552)

# ORDER PARAMETER:
Original Code: Mean = 0.34, SD = 0.033, Range = (0.2523, 0.3928)
New Version: Mean = 0.31, SD = 0.030, Range = (0.262, 0.3536)
